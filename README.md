# 🚀 Flashloan Arbitrage Smart Contract System
## ⭐ Available for Web3 Development Work

I am currently open to paid smart contract and blockchain development projects.

Payment accepted in cryptocurrency (USDT / BNB / ETH).
## 👨‍💻 Web3 Developer Portfolio

Hi, I am a Solidity and Web3 developer specializing in smart contract development, deployment, and automation systems.

I build production-style blockchain solutions including DeFi interaction scripts and contract architecture design.

I focus on delivering clean production-ready Solidity code and fast communication with clients.
I can start working immediately on new development tasks.
